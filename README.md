## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Analysis failed" errors:**
- Verify GOOGLE_API_KEY and SERPAPI_API_KEY are set correctly
- Check API key permissions and remaining credits
- Ensure URLs are accessible (not behind login walls)
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**No competitors discovered:**
- Verify SERPAPI_API_KEY is configured
- Check SerpAPI account credits and rate limits
- Try different URLs to test API connectivity
- Ensure "Include competitor discovery" checkbox is checked

**Empty topical opportunities:**
- This is often correct - indicates good competitive coverage
- "Comprehensive Content Coverage" message means no gaps found
- Try analyzing different industry verticals for comparison

**Incorrect percentages in Market Topics:**
- Fixed in current version with integrity checks
- Should show realistic percentages (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- If still seeing 500%+ values, backend needs updating

### Debug Information
- Enable browser console for detailed logging
- Look for "üîç" prefixed debug messages
- Check API response structure in console output
- Verify request/response timing for SerpAPI integration
